00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,339
Hello and welcome back to the course on deep natural

2
00:00:03,339 --> 00:00:05,679
language processing. And today we're going to talk about

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:09,000
the types of natural language processing. So we've got

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,130
two men diagrams here or we got a band diagram

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:16,589
of two circles in it, and we're going to

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:23,230
look at the different areas off natural language processing that

7
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:25,550
are going to come up in this course. So

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,149
on the letter got natural language processing overall on DH

9
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:33,280
. This refers to the whole circle on the left

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,630
. So the reason why we've called in just this

11
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,490
green part is because that's the non overlapping part.

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,189
So we know that anything in here eyes just national

13
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:46,070
language processing without with disregard to this second circle.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,039
But natural language processing is indeed everything that is in

15
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,289
this first circle. Then we've got on the right

16
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,850
deep learning. So these are all algorithms that have

17
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:00,439
something to do with neural networks. Deep learning,

18
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,540
basically anything that's called the Deep learned Algren falls in

19
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,909
here. They don't have to be national language processing

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,590
. They could be classification. They could be anything

21
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,269
so they could be. That's deplorable. Here on

22
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:17,959
national language processing is any algorithm an immortal that has

23
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:23,219
something to do with President ofthe natural language into machine

24
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:26,120
terms. And then finally, in the overlap,

25
00:01:26,129 --> 00:01:30,170
we have deep NLP. So these are models which

26
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,099
have to do with national language processing, but also

27
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:38,400
which are deep learning malls, neural network models on

28
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,680
DH? Yes. Oh, that's the part that

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,060
we're going to be aiming for. But it's also

30
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,950
very good to have visibility off all three, because

31
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,209
in this course we will be talking about some models

32
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:52,939
that fall just in here. And then we'll be

33
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:55,109
talking about most here, and I'll be good to

34
00:01:55,109 --> 00:01:57,890
compare and see how the world has changed over time

35
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:00,043
and why these models are off for better than these

36
00:02:00,043 --> 00:02:02,933
ones. Um, another thing to note here is

37
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:07,902
that the size of these diagrams is not reflective off

38
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:12,923
the importance or the volumes off thes different fields.

39
00:02:12,923 --> 00:02:15,673
So I just said circles of the same size simply

40
00:02:15,673 --> 00:02:20,173
because we want a visual representation of off the overlap

41
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,263
and that these fields exist. But don't take the

42
00:02:23,263 --> 00:02:25,242
size into account. It's not to scale at all

43
00:02:27,143 --> 00:02:32,103
. And finally there is another part. Another part

44
00:02:32,103 --> 00:02:35,992
of this event diagram, which is very important to

45
00:02:35,992 --> 00:02:38,263
us. And it is this part over here,

46
00:02:38,812 --> 00:02:44,633
a sub section off a deep NLP cold sequence to

47
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:46,453
sequence. So sequence the sequence models on the most

48
00:02:46,453 --> 00:02:50,943
cutting edge the most powerful models that exists right now

49
00:02:50,943 --> 00:02:53,302
for national language processing. And that's what we're going

50
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:57,573
to be looking at. So as you'll see throughout

51
00:02:57,573 --> 00:02:59,592
this course, you will make a way through the

52
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:01,832
national language processing side of things into deep NLP,

53
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:05,652
and then we'll go into sequence to sequence. It

54
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,573
will be a fun and exciting journey on DH.

55
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:09,152
The other thing that I wanted to mention is you

56
00:03:09,152 --> 00:03:13,532
will also notice that throughout this course, even though

57
00:03:13,532 --> 00:03:15,193
it's focused on chatbots, we won't be talking about

58
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:20,203
Just chat boards will be looking at different examples off

59
00:03:20,973 --> 00:03:23,443
how these models from here from here and from here

60
00:03:23,552 --> 00:03:27,983
can be applied to different things. Because the applications

61
00:03:27,992 --> 00:03:30,462
are huge. We can talk. We can apply

62
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:34,013
them in a natural you neural mission. Translation.

63
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:37,182
We're gonna play them in image capture name. We

64
00:03:37,182 --> 00:03:42,103
can apply them in speech recognition questions and answers.

65
00:03:42,103 --> 00:03:44,272
Tex immunization. Lots of lots of models, so

66
00:03:45,293 --> 00:03:47,402
we will be looking at different ones and they will

67
00:03:47,402 --> 00:03:50,943
be up to protect. So this map will come

68
00:03:50,943 --> 00:03:53,002
in handy as we go through the course and then

69
00:03:53,002 --> 00:03:54,052
we'll be popping up here and there. So I

70
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:58,302
think it was very important for us to set the

71
00:03:58,312 --> 00:04:00,543
foundation right, so that now we're age proceed.

72
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:02,723
And I can't wait to see you on the next

73
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:05,693
tutorial. And until then, enjoy deep a national

74
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:06,673
language processing.
